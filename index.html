    <p class="some-description">
        I give tours of Boston as a hobby. I read a great deal, at least a book a week sometimes more. I have a degree in Economics,
        one in Communications/Media and a Real Estate licence. I am a notary public. I've traveled to 22 countries and 46
        US states. I am planning a trip to England to see the HMS Victory, Nelson's flagship at Trafalgar where he was killed.
        My goal is to go to Halifax, Nova Scotia, Iceland and Durango, Wyoming. I would like to go to Bruges someday. I go
        to a Congregational church and work on a van that feeds and clothes homeless people in Boston. I am not married,
        nor have I ever been married. I have no girlfriend. I have no children. I come from a large family. I don't drink
        or do drugs or smoke (except sometimes cigars). I am unemployed. And now I have to go feed the cat.</p>
